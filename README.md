Context

The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to
success. However, many apps are being developed every single day and only a few of
them become profitable. It is important for developers to be able to predict the
success of their app and incorporate features that make an app successful.
We can collect app data and user ratings from the app stores and use it to extract
insightful information.
A machine learning model can be used to predict a rating for a given app, which can
be used to estimate success and scope of improvement. Actionable insights learned
through such analysis can be used by developers to make a successful app and
capture the Android market.
